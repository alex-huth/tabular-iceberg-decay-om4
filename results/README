Gridded model results, both directly from model output (gridded*.nc) and from the fl_traj_to_grid notebooks (traj_to_grid_sh*.nc and traj_to_grid_nh*.nc, where sh and nh refer to the Southern and Northern hemispheres, respectively). The fl_traj_to_grid notebooks (in ./../figures) calculate the average iceberg area within 100 km of each grid point, using icebergs with areas greater than a given threshold.
