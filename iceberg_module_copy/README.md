# Krazy Icebergs Dude (KID)

KID is a Lagrangian element model of icebergs. Initially, the icebergs were represented as infinitesimal points (Martin & Adcroft, 2010), and then given finite extent and element-element interactions so that can now represent giant tabular icebergs by joining elements togeter (Stern et al., 2017).

It should be noted that the K and D in KID can be anything you like, e.g. Kinematic and Dynamics. Suggestions are welcome, since we haven't thought of anything that makes sense.
